🚀 Quick Start Guide: Interlinear Translator Pro
This guide covers everything you need to know to master the plugin in 60 seconds.

1. No Configuration Mode (Default)
If you just want to see the plugin in action, you don't need to configure anything beforehand.

By default, the plugin is ready to process text using a basic internal logic or cached translations if available.

You can install it and run the command immediately to see the interface.

2. Advanced Setup (Translation Engines)
To get actual translations, you must choose one of these two paths in the Plugin Settings:

☁️ Option A: Google Translate (Fastest)
Best for: High speed and support for 100+ languages.

Go to Settings > Interlinear Translator Pro.

Select Google Translate as the provider.

Paste your Google Cloud API Key.

Tip: You can get this key from the Google Cloud Console under "Credentials".

🏠 Option B: Ollama (100% Private & Offline)
Best for: Privacy and users with powerful computers.

Install Ollama from ollama.com.

Open your terminal and download a model (e.g., ollama pull mistral).

In Obsidian Settings, select Ollama as the provider.

Ensure the Model Name matches exactly (e.g., mistral).
